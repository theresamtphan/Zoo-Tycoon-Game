# Zoo-Tycoon-Game.

Zoo tycoon is a game that allows players to run a zoo business. 
Different types of animals cost different prices, have different maintenance costs, and of course, return a different profit at the end of each day. 
For this game, the player will be the proud owner of a virtual zoo that has spaces to house tigers, penguins and turtles.

This program runs the Zoo Tycoon simulation.
The player begins the game with a certain amount of money in the bank.
They have the option to buy animals (tigers, penguins, or turtles)
and must pay the related upkeep costs for their animals such as 
food and random events (sickness, boom in zoo attendance, and baby
animal is born). Players have the opportunity to keep playing until
they run out of money or if they wish to stop playing.
